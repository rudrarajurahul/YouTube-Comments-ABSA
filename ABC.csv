Semper Fortis,"As a Veteran I must say.... The language of ""loyalty"" is deeply disturbing, and disconcerting. Civvies are standing by while people die overseas for what they refuse to defend at home.

I would like to take the opportunity to share my thoughts with anyone who is interested; it would mean a lot to this  Veteran  if you consider reading what I put the time and effort into typing. Think of it as a way of thanking me for my service; it is my way of sharing my perspective with fellow Americans, veteran and civilian alike.... regardless of political affiliation."
Sly 1,I’m glad that I learned how to cut my own hair and fade when I was in the military. If anybody wants to learn how to cut hair. Just YouTube how to cut my own hair with using different guards with fade

Now I'm supposed to trust these businesses with my safety when we still don't even know exactly how it's spread and still don't test enough to know who had/ has it? 
I wouldn't trust any of these mnfers with my life or my family's life. Just stupid. I don't even want people in my own home to leave and come back. No way I'm going to go to a barber shop and come home. "

BrendaSue Pete,"About half of us already have immunity,  the rest of us need That immunity."
jimmy aber,Simple precaution of face cover for all when in a building could make so much difference. We seem to not want to be bothered or believe we are invincible. Too many in my area below 50 years of age with minor or no underlying problems died.
DaFiresMen,"To be completely fair the death toll should be read as ""possibly"" Covid 19 deaths. If a person has symptoms and have not been tested, they are listed as a death. I understand that because you are not going to waste a test on a dead person."
Nina Banana,"i hope the economy is worth risking lives of the front liners. If they die off, do we have a plan B?"
Mark Howard,This is more cyberpunk than i could ever imagine.  I am watching a weirdo on tv worrying about getting her haircut while the barber is dressed in some corpogov safeguard.  Capitalism/consumerism/vanity.  I love this brasil thing we have made.
Luan Nguyen,While hospitals face a shortage of protective equipment. These hair salons and restaurants are geared up to run their business. Ridiculous.
alex rios,Good for them//The money make the money make the money//Don’t forget get a life insurance🦠😷💀

JVP Connects,Does anyone know if Kemp's family is out and about? Does he let them take the risk?
John A Vallone,Nobody's making anybody open up. It's up to the business owner. Governor not telling you that you have to open up. He saying you can and not be thrown in jail or fined like a lot of other states are doing.
Joshuavangorden,Will let's see what happens in  2 weeks may 8th we will see. I hope no one gets sick. However the greed of $$ rules everything.
Matthew Boggs,Just a few businesses! How many? All of them!!!!!
Clifton Harris,"the stores may be open, but it's ultimately up to you if you still practice being distanced."
H Lee,Seems the business owners are being careful and taking precautions. Wishing Georgians the best and hoping there isn’t a crazy spike in covid cases. 🙏🏻
Gabe Shakour,I definitely like the businesses that are being really smart about how they open and maintain social-distancing. That hair salon with the two guys seemed to really have a good procedure in place. I just hope that this reopening wasn’t preemptive and before we learned everything we need to know about this virus.
Adam Konieczny,They are all going to get sick...
Artful Soul,Personal choice

En P,Well men should have taken this chance to shave there heads
thedonleroy,How in the world are movie theaters & bowling alleys important enough to be among the first businesses to reopen?
Apr-83,At least some people still have common sense.
BARRY ZARCULiA,I agree with the mayor . Bowling and Hair and Nails arent a necessity

LIL JON'S,Stay home for football..
Sweet Ambitions,So basically all the places that cater to the rich and idle?
hiphug1ger,"I think these places that are opening need to require that everyone who leaves their house needs to be wearing a mask, face shields at restaurants so you can eat but keep you saliva to yourself."
Dwight Prewitt,Here in Atlanta surrounding area It was still ppl out during the stay at home order..... U ride by the supermarkets or home improvement stores... They are packed with ppl... I'm a truck driver Here and stores I deliver to be packed...

snorkle99,Minecraft is a great way to deal with this
What Is Hot Today,Just DUMB
Berk Sarioz,"So let me get this straight. We're igniting the economy by CONSUMING more non-essential services and products? Maybe just maybe, we don't need that much money if we're only spending on essentials. I understand we need redistribution for housing/business rent expenses, but still. How's economy being great by a short haired lady getting a haircut she can really survive without."
Steven R.,"Deny them care if they get sick. It would be a waste since they are so willing to get infected.  Can't wait for these idiots to die out.

Jonathan Ngo,Was her first customer the girl from Orange Is The New Black??
Jazzie Red,"All those people wearing masks....  Improperly.  That lady on the phone, huge gaps everywhere."
Strelnikov,"I'm confused by their ""mixed feelings"", given that the Georgia government isn't forcing anyone to open back up, they are simply allowing business to make their own choices again.... If you are uneasy about opening up, just don't open up."
aspie40hero,"I have a question,  how does gloves and a mask, protect someones elbows and forearms,  in a massage? Covid is also spread through sweat and ingrown hairs, zits, as well as dead skin. It's just foolish to reopen massage therapists or pts, or personal trainers. Do some research first. The governor seems like he wants everyone to get sick."
Foxplayz,As a bald person lol... all I have to do is order a bunch of razors
digitaldirtnap1,"Hopefully it goes well and the rest start opening cautiously. Cape cod Massachusetts we don’t have many affected, hundreds out of tens of thousands maybe hundred thousand? I’ll edit.so 225,000 year round and maybe double that for summer, I honestly believe it’ll be ok."
dru's take,"So, African communities being hit the hardest... Georgia  having one of the largest African American communities in the U.S... just seems weird."

Love T,"As short as her hair is, she could have done it herself... I don’t see the point of risking your health for that small amount of hair..."
George Vreeland Hill,It's going to get worse because of this. We will pay.
Dan Kuo,Fake news ABC is spreading confusion again as each business is free to open safely by complying with Federal and State recommendations. No one is pointing a gun to force reopening.
Dennis Campoverde-Lema,"Don't put Minnesota on that list we open marinas (dock and boat rentals) cabin resort, golf courses, and bait shop for fishing.  All these activities you can social distance yourself"

I’m in Minnesota and they made it sound like we’re reopening.... Certainly not the case, Governor Walz gave the ok for office buildings with no inside customers the ok to reopen with strict distancing policies for workers. He said Gyms, Hair Salons, Bowling alleys, Bars/Restaurants and Tattoo shops will be one of the last on the list to open. With sporting events and Concerts being the absolute last."

jeebs621,"I don’t know why a hairdresser would want to do hair. It’s literally person to person contact, I feel that’d probably be the worst/easiest way to contract the virus."
Jordan Dude,3:16 Wtf
Dee J,FEAR..Fear..Fear..Fear... MSM is a joke!
Stanley C,"Yea, I can see why Georgia has to open with all these debt in their state's balance sheet. They also don't need to pay unemployment benefits once businesses are open. Workers no longer qualifies so they have to force to work. It also shifted a lot of the unemployment payments to small business owners rather than from the state. This is not good at all. A lot of small businesses owner is going to die with rising coronavirus cases. Georgia hasn't even peaked yet."
Larry Langley,a Flair-up is Dead people
Alex Miller,"Ok I’m sorry, I don’t think nail salons or hair cut places are known as “essential jobs” in the time of an epidemic, I don’t think if somebody “looks good” even matters. Good for them for taking every precaution available though. I’m happy they are trying to be smart about it at least."

rivernorthhomes,"What good is staying closed another month..the virus will still be there waiting outside. USA took the wrong approach, but keeping everyone locked inside you are just delaying the inevitable when they are free to go out. Sweden took the best approach and they are a few weeks out from obtaining herd immunity. Sweden kept everything open but told the elderly and the sick to stay home. That is what we should have done"

I want to open as much as anyone else. I have a business to run. But to me, human rights exceeds my economic rights. Money comes and goes, human lives does not."

Dove Daniels,how can someone clean and sanitize the salon after every customer and guest. that's a lie. it would take about 2 to 4 hours to clean the entire salon after each person. they should stop stretching the truth. and you have to change your gloves and capes for every guest. you will have to buy a pack of gloves every 3 days or so. they are stretching the truth. ijs but good luck to them. my life comes first and my guest are glad i am staying closed. someone said cutting hair is her life's work. I like growing and evolving not stagnant. some times things happen for a reason to push you out of your comfort zone.

Jesus Flores,"I'm not hopeful that he is right. I am hopeful that citizens stay healthy and safe and do the best they can to protect themselves and everyone around them. Love your neighbor. Love all those around you as you love yourself. Keep everybody safe. This will not prevent cases of the virus. In fact, it is sure to either stay as flat as it is, but longer than it would if they just sheltered in place, or it will cause a rise in cases. Hopefully, it won't be a big rise. Stay safe everybody."
Mjiles Jiles,The mayor's hot.😍
Lance A,"Unemployment is your money. It's what is taken in part of your check. Georgia haven't hit their peak yet. 6 feet ain't far enough. Georgia workers are letting their jobs kill them.

Carlos Navarro,Does the word asymptomatic sound familiar.......and do they know what it means?.......it only took one to spread it around the world...let alone a state.....once again............animal gets run over and will learn the lesson....a human get run over and he will cross the same road the same way.........Georgia will be an outbreak starting point for a second wave in winter.

Nacho,"No movies coming out. Restaurants opening up means you need to hire or bring back staff, which means more expenses not just paying them but for equipment, electrical, gas, usage, more cleaning more sanitizing for a few customers who probably wont leave a tip. Does that justify thing, why not add a virus on top of that. I totally understand why some people dont want to go back to work or why some restaurants would rather stay close or do to go order only, not only is it cheaper but not as risky either."

Allen Albright,"Masks are a good idea for preventing airborne spread of the virus, however only N 95 masks are protective according to some Chinese studies.

Staying away from people is what has to be done at this time. "

Chris Tr1ut8,"Omg, how many times are people going to compare deaths between a virus and a war. They are not comparable things. This is an interesting thing to observe. I know this virus and pandemic are real, but they wouldn’t have to be. The government and media are 100% in control of people. They could tell the people whatever they want to tell them and people will do as they’re told. They say that the stay home orders are the only reason we have kept the numbers to where they are at. That just doesn’t make sense though. How would we even know that? How do we know the trajectory of the curve wasn’t entirely timing based. We can’t really compare it to anything other than Sweden and South Korea. Every other country in the world did what we did here. South Korea is probably a bad example to use, but Sweden hasn’t faired any worse off than the US. I personally don’t think it made much of a difference. I was all for the shut down when it started, but I’m changing my mind at this point."
Jackal N,"Remember before the measles outbreak last year in America, many anti-vaccers where so high and mighty about their rights.  they had to see the effects on their babies before they rush to get it.

Bertdog,"It is astounding to see the number of people willing to give up their rights to the Chinese Wuhan virus.  I pity you fools.  In the end there will be more deaths from society shutting down then from the virus itself.  Most ""non-essential"" jobs are in the government bureaucracy, not in the private sector.  Self-distancing, better hygiene,  better care for the elderly (and those with health issues} makes sense but shutting down people's livelihoods is wrong and just plain evil.  I would also agree that those that feel they need to hide under their beds should feel free to do so."
blastman8888,I'm not all sure Doctors know exactly what to do they are basing their modals that have wildly different outcomes. Example Mexico never closed anything down and they have only 5000 deaths nation wide. If anything I would have expected 100-300k dead by now there.
udlock9,"After all the deaths, dont forget we have a war to fight too. Lets have a war with all our enemy nations, people can die but we must show them who is the boss in the world. Just breed more children, the weak can perish but America must thrive again by continuing the wars against China, Russia, Iran, etc. I don’t care how many weaklings die from the virus but we must fight on, that’s what our president want and what USA want. Where ever the president lead us, I will follow."

I know China's number is cooked but at least they removed quarantine when they see almost no more increase in the confirm cases. Look at S.Korea. they achieved it by doing so many tests. Increase the capacity of testing first!!! why do we plan to increase it after we open the economy????"

Lars O,Fear and panic people... good lord can you get yourselves together and look at what is really happening?  Grocery stores have remained open.  People go there every day.  The infection rates are still going down.  The biggest help in all of this is people getting there act together as far as personal sanitation.  Before this mess I rarely saw guys that washed their hands when they left the restroom.  Yeah...ick.  But that is TYPICAL.  Now virtually everybody washes their hands.  People I ate lunch or dinner with rarely washed their hands before eating.  I bet they do now.  The social distancing is moderately effective but the personal sanitation is the key.  And getting the fear and panic under control is crucial people!  Stress lowers your immune response.  Think and stop allowing yourselves to be force fed panic.

I have seen many different sides to this whole thing and so many different opinions and stats but why risk it? The fact is there is NO CURE, NO VACCINE, it kills thousands like me with asthma and COPD and 52,000 (possibly) people have died from this mess.

Is there a difference between Donald Trump and Jim Jones, I do not think so except that Donald Trump can't lose. He will win if you live or die it really doesn't matter. If you go back to work or die-off of Social Security you will be saving the government money. I grew up trying to be an independent person I am going to die in a commune where everybody is anxious to see God one way or another. Stupid will be with us for another four years at least.

It isn't going to go away by everyone hiding in their houses all year. Why do Atlanta business owners care if the state opens up? They don't have to open their business if they feel uncomfortable. People who want to wear masks and stay 6 feet from everyone the rest of their life they are entitled to do that. Sounds like a wonderful way to live. Scared and isolated from all friends, loved ones, and the rest of society. I'd rather take my chances with the virus that 98-99 percent will recover from or maybe not even show any symptoms."

Carlos,Kemp's decision to open these businesses rather than bolster unemployment and get money into people's bank accounts is criminal and will cost lives. I'm ashamed to be a Georgian right now ...
Cant think of a name,I hope New York City is next!
The Unblinking Eye,"The scaremongering never ends.  Worldwide there have been 196K deaths, not the millions that were threatened.  Most of the world population is not on lockdown.
Outside of Wuhan, most of China never had a lockdown."
North Eastern Roberts,Let's watch the lab rats
Genevieve Thompson,I wish Atlanta and all the other States luck I live in NYC I am also a healthcare worker all I have to say good luck because you all going to need it
D Dellinger,"50k how many of those were trumped up to be covid 19, a woman in hospice care that was going to die any day was classified as covid19. a man in a motorcycle accident was classified covid19. he clearly died from the crash., and there are many more. we heard on the hot mic it is just like the regular flu as far as numbers go. all the doctors have said more than 99% of the people that get this will recover with no complications. in the whole world there are less than a quarter million and almost all of those were older people that had underlying conditions. if you are older and have underlying conditions you should take precautions, but i'm sure you already do that with the regular flu. i don't recall l;ast flu season people living in fear this. a lot of people might have already had this and didn't even know it. many people are on video saying no big deal."
Bigfat Pauly,"FIRE TRUMP #55,000"
G L,Let the dying begin.
bpxl53yewz,"Although the governor wanted all these places open, interesting that many of them chose not to and their staff thanked the owners. He's not the one who has to work and come in contact with many others, they are. Easy for him to say ""go back to work"". Georgia was only in shelter-in for 3 wks. That's nothing."
Zinxeb Zinxeb,Georgia and all of the rest of red states gave all of their state's revenue to their wealthy campaign donors...so they can't afford to pay unemployment to keep their residents home and safe.

Warren Goss,Stay closed and loose your business. The Democrats don't care.
E turnall,WHEN YOU TAKE THE PERSONAL AGENDA OUT OF THE PICTURE THE CLARITY FOR HUMANITY WILL OPEN. SAD FOR THOSE THAT OPEN . WEEKS LATER WHEN THOSE LOVED ONE DROP DEAD BEFORE THERE FEET THEY WILL REGRET OPENING . WHEN THE MAJORITY OF THOSE ARE AGAINST THE REOPENING THEY WILL ALWAYS LOOK AT THOSE BUSINESSES IN A BAD WAY. SO SAD TO BAD BUT WHO WANTS TO SUPPORT THOSE THAT LACK REALITY AND HAVE NO REGARD FOR THE REST OF AMERICANS
Andrew,Libertarianism is a mental illness
Lori Carver,Those are the last things that should open IN MY OPINION. I am glad to see this hair dresser wearing a face shield!!!!!! That’s awesome using protection!!!!!! Just please be careful please!!!!!!!!
gdlywom,Barbers: Please put some seats outside so your clients can sit and wait.
Courtney Renfro,You want us to stay at home . Not all companies can switch to working at home .   It’s not that hard we are adults . Either you stay home or not . You open your business or choose not to . I was walking this guy was close to me . I can’t control what people do . Why does this have to be a discussion ?!
Damien Holland,I understand the economic pressure. But I think if they drive up those pandemic numbers it might impact the economy in unexpected or worse ways (to say nothing about their hospitals having the potential for being overloaded). So this is really an experiment.
AZMademe,This can't be safe
DesperadoAmericano,"what if, now i know this is crazy, but what if i just didn't get a haircut for a whole year, and we all had a mutual agreement that long or messy hair is fine for now?"
Section8 millionaire,Don't worry lefties. Us right wing crazies will preserve your constitutional rights when the government over reaches after you sell out for a government check. You can thank us later.
Little Miss Muffet,Dont they realize that the majority that has died has been black at any age ?  The people backing this re open campaign certainly do .
Caleb Mattocks,"No one is forcing them to open, if they are afraid and dont want to open then dont open. Not a big deal."
Mike Barnes,I really hope I'm wrong but in 3 weeks or so u will all get sick for going g for a haircut. As a Canadian I feel bad for the smart Americans who take this seriously cuz it's only a small portion of population who's out and about . They just get a lot of publicity.  And yes they are social distancing and everything when the cameras are rolling
Chang Hsieh,Maybe the only way out of this is sadly for everyone to get infected and survival of the fittest.
G THE KING,Shame people are so addicted to having fun they'll kill themselves to do it......
Sam Giler,BIG MISTAKE BIG MISTAKE! GA is going to regret it i can 'guarantee' you that

HTPC,My family and i we will not take any chances.!! We will stay home!!! If you are in the group of the people that want to go out and get infected and die .!! Well good luck to you i hope you don’t get for family sick 😷 as well.
john wilson,Not taking any changes on this virus #stayinside #staysafe
Paul Rice,"Georgia was germ 🦠 infested before the pandemic quietly 🤫 killing people all around the state, but now we have a monster just waiting on the side walk selling death 💀 and you want me to just walk into your restaurant and order a plate of death 💀 with my hard earned money 💰no thank you ☺️ I am old and I was promised that I could stay here on earth 🌎 for 100 years and by George, Jim or Alice that what I am going to do."
graffitypsycho,Can we use the money to build the wall. To build a wall around Georgia? Keep them in a bubble with their beautiful haircut.
HTPC,We you are the that hospital bed will be too late and don’t be crying about just remember nobody but you put yourself there!! I hope you don’t suffer too much but I heard it is very painful😣
Claudette S,Willing to die and kill ppl for vanity. Gross.
lak sher,"Yup, put your life at risk for a hair cut. watch the number of cases go back up again because of this."
M J,3 billion? you can replace money but you can't replace lives
Chatty Ashley,This sucks. I understand folks need money to pay their bills. Thats the problem. I dont understand folks who cant groom themselves. Wtf.
